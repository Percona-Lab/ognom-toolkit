# License disclaimer

As noted in the source code, this program borrows heavily (i.e. at
times copies) from facebookgo/dvara and gopacket. This means it cannot
be licensed as GPL.

Eventually, I may rewrite all of this, maintaining functionality, so
that it can be included in the global license for tokumx-toolkit, but
for now, please refer to

https://github.com/google/gopacket/blob/master/LICENSE

and

https://github.com/facebookgo/dvara/blob/master/license

Essentially, those are BSD licensed, which means this program is presently also
BSD licensed.
